### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as [creating a new issue](https://github.com/practice-proactive/ama/issues) on this project. 

we'll try to answer (reasonable questions) it as soon as we can get to them. 
Once we answer we'll close the issue just so we know what we've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and we'll get back to you soon. 
Feel free to ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.
